real world project
## Problem Statement (Business Market) 

Here we are working under a Biotech startup going to launch its Home checkup service with Online booking offering few services.
Full Body Checkup with a Bio-Tech Device based on Blood Samples.
Online Health Techs offering -
Diabetes checkup device, 
 Blood Pressure checkup device, 
Vitamins deficiency checkup device. 
We needed to analyze the medical market in India for these products and services, Study the general traits of customers using data and market segmentation, to come up with a strategy to enter the market. Finding out how to have more customers, retain customers, make more sales, and find methods so that customers will prefer us more using Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, Behavioral factors.

## Target segments from data :

### For diabetes -

We found  2 target segments for diabetes from the available datasets with following characteristics.

|| Hence the Target segment of diabetes patients ( age group above 55) will cover 66.43% patients which can do full body checkup along with diabetes. ||

|| Target segments for full body checkup is age group above 55 having no diabetes with 88.16% patients having polyuria, polyphagia, polydipsia. ||

### For Blood Pressure-
Here I found segments of blood pressure disease from the data that I have analyzed and from their features.

|| If the Glucose level is low we maintain then the problem of blood pressure will automatically low and avoid all bad habits which will decrease blood pressure level. The older we are, our body reacts to glucose level. In the 30 to 40 age group the highest changes of blood pressure problem will occur.||

For vitamins we didn't find a better dataset describing patients characteristics so derived segments for potential regions using research.


## Finding out target market region (states)

### For diabetes - 
Major states in India with Diabetes :
1. Tamil Nadu: 13% of urban and 3.5% of rural population is suffering from diabetes.
2. Kerala: The most cases of diabetes in Kerala fall under the 45 to 69 years category. That counts to 19.4% of people suffering from Diabetes.
3. Gujarat: That accounts for 7.1% of diabetic cases in Gujarat for India.
4. Chandigarh:  has about 13.6% of prevalence of diabetes.
5. Tripura:  too has been reported with 9.1% of its history with diabetes. The GDP is somewhere above 2000 US dollars.
6. Maharashtra: The state has revealed about 8.4% of prevalence of diabetes in the ratio of GDP reaching 2500 US dollar.
7. Andhra Pradesh:  has reported 8.4% of diabetes prevalence
           # State - population - patient count - internet users - patient internet user

 From data we have gathered above stats.
          
1. We know how many % Population is having diabetes so we found the patient count.
2. We don't know how many % internet users have diabetes, but we took estimation with same % as for population then found Patients count using internet
3.  Our target segment will have patients above age 50-60.
4. But Data is available about the count or % of patients above 50 age.
5. But, we can assume that each household can have 1 person above age 50.
6. The internet user count is: no. of households using the internet.
7. Hence as 1 person from 1 household being above age 50. We can consider this internet using household count as count of people above age 50.
8. Hence we found a patient count who uses the internet and is above age 50 as a Patient internet user.

#### Hence we found

1. Overall patient count (column - “Patient count whole”)
2. Patients using the internet and above age 50 (column - “Patient internet users”)
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh are states with more - people above age 50, more internet users, and more people belonging to middle class ( *from EDA of inpatients_statistics_2018.csv )

#### Good count of targeted patients
1.Tamil Nadu - potential patient count - 100,360
2. Kerala - Potential patient count - 93,702
3. Maharashtra - potential patient count - 84,000
4. Andhra Pradesh - Potential patient count - 46,116

### Finding out potential patient count for diabetesregion ( Districts) :

#### Tamil Nadu-

These are states with more - people above age 50, more internet users, and more people belonging to middle class 
 
Tiruvallur, Chennai, Kanchipuram, Coimbatore, Vellore, Salem, Madurai, Tiruchirappalli

No. of patients of all types including diabetes (referring to inpatients_statistics_2018.csv data)

1. Chennai - 37,38,133
2. Coimbatore - 6, 66,891
3. Kanchipuram - 5,14,341
4. Madurai - 9,69,071
5. Tirunelveli - 5,60,741
6. Salem - 5,45,694
So considering these numbers and 4 characteristics of people above age 50, more internet users, and more people belonging to middle class

#### Good count of targeted patients districts in Tamil Nadu ( 100,360 Target Potential patient count for state)
1. Chennai
2. Coimbatore
3. Madurai
These are the target region for diabetes
From Tamil Nadu considering all features listed and states above these districts are potential market for diabetes and also for full body checkup ( as 66.43% patients having diabetes also suffer other diseases) [*see target segment of diabetes].

#### Kerala-
These are states with more - people above age 50, more internet users, and more people belonging to middle class - Trivandrum, Ernakulam, Thrissur
 
We didn't found proper dataset showing patients count per district but from research we found
1. Pathanamthitta district of Kerala has the maximum number of diabetics—16 per cent people in the district suffer from the lifestyle disease
2. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes among a group of urban residents in Trivandrum city in Kerala is very high. This is associated also with a high detection rate and compliance to treatment.
so considering these numbers and 4 characteristics of people above age 50, more internet users, and more people belonging to middle class
#### Good count of targeted patients districts in Kerala.
Pathanamthitta
Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram)
are the target region for diabetes. From Kerala considering all features listed and states above these districts are potential market for diabetes and also for full body checkup ( as 66.43% patients having diabetes also suffer other diseases) [*see target segment of diabetes].
 
### For Heart related issues/Disease - 
#### Results:
Disability Affected Life Years (DALYs) is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.
While the rate of DALYs for ischemic heart disease was 3,062 per 100,000 people for India, it was the highest in Punjab (5,759) followed by Tamil Nadu (4,788) and Haryana (4,244).
Other states with higher DALYs than the national average were Andhra Pradesh (4,023), Maharashtra (3,658), Karnataka (3,892) and Gujarat (3,736).

#### Target Regions:
Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh (Preferred Southern Part of India)

 
### For Blood Pressure - 
#### Results:
Overall prevalence for hypertension in India was 29.8% (95% confidence interval: 26.7–33.0).
Significant differences in hypertension prevalence were noted between rural and urban parts [27.6% (23.2–32.0) and 33.8% (29.7–37.8); P = 0.05]. Regional estimates for the prevalence of hypertension were as follows: 14.5% (13.3–15.7), 31.7% (30.2–33.3), 18.1% (16.9–19.2), and 21.1% (20.1–22.0) for rural north, east, west, and south India; and 28.8% (26.9–30.8), 34.5% (32.6–36.5), 35.8% (35.2–36.5), and 31.8% (30.4–33.1) for urban north, east, west, and south India, respectively.
Overall estimates for the prevalence of awareness, treatment, and control of BP were 25.3% (21.4–29.3), 25.1% (17.0–33.1), and 10.7% (6.5–15.0) for rural Indians; and 42.0% (35.2–48.9), 37.6% (24.0–51.2), and 20.2% (11.6–28.7) for urban Indians.
#### Conclusion:
About 33% of urban and 25% of rural Indians are hypertensive. Of these, 25% rural and 42% urban Indians are aware of their hypertensive status. Only 25% rural and 38% of urban Indians are being treated for hypertension. One-tenth of rural and one-fifth of urban Indian hypertensive population have their BP under control.
#### Target Regions:
As we can see BP is prevailing in all the places over India with very small variations in rural and urban regions.
From the data, we have north and south regions having small variations in rural and urban regions, east and west regions are similar in rural and urban regions.
Any region is good for setting up the service for blood pressure. In the east and western parts setting the service in urban regions has an added advantage.
So as patients are equally spread across India in terms of count and also for diabetes and heart related issues we are getting Tamil nadu as the best region to start with considering various factors of age, living class, internet accessibility, etc. for blood pressure also we can start with Tamil nadu.
 
### For Vitamins - 
A high overall prevalence (52%) of vitamin D deficiency was observed in the analysis. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency between rural and urban subjects (P < 0.05) and among the subjects pursuing different occupations (P < 0.001). A significant gender-specific difference was also recorded at the cut-off level of 25 (OH) D, with women showing higher prevalence of deficiency compared to men (P < 0.05).
As per NFHS 4 (2015-16), nearly half (53%) of the children under 5 years of age in Jharkhand received Vitamin A supplementation in the past six months. Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey, 2017 reveals that the prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency in Jharkhand is 42.3% among children aged 1-4 years. Hence Vitamin A is an essential nutrition intervention for the state and biannual rounds are aimed at higher coverage of Vitamin A. While in punjab and  uttarakhand Vitamin D deficiencies are found the most 52.1% and 46.4% respectively and their population is 3.07 Crore and 4.09 Crore respectively. Hence we get patient count-

1.Punjab - 15,994,700
2.Jharkhand - 18,977,600

In Punjab 62.52% of the population lives in Urban areas and 37.48% lives in Rural areas. In Jharkhand ⅓ of the population is tribal.

Punjab - 9,999,886
Jharkhand - 6,325,866

Punjab and jharkhand has 70% and 29% people use internet hence( here we consider/estimate that tribes may not have internet or mobile access)

Target customer for Punjab will be 6,999,920
Target customer for jharkhand will be 1,834,501 
Hence total customers - 8,834,421

Deducting the count for other accessibility issues approx. 80 lakhs. With health drives and injection camps the government is trying to solve this big issue and will cover a big count in action. Still this vitamins deficiency checkup is necessary in such drives, to take follow ups.  
Target regions - Punjab, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand are target regions as they have more no. of people facing vitamins deficiencies. 

### For Full body checkup - 

For a full body checkup we can consider all the regions mentioned above. As there we found specific blood pressure, diabetes, vitamins deficiency patients along with some others patients who require checkup. So those patients along with categories can be included for full body checkup. 

## Pricing : 
Pricing can range between Rs.600 to Rs.1000 to be affordable for patients. As we saw in earlier points. In Chennai as a metro city, pricing can be increased compared to Madurai and Trivandrum.
Also the device can vary between Rs.1800 to Rs. 2800. It will be affordable as it will serve patients for at least 5 years.These are starting pricing ranges as it’s an early market scenario.
### For home checkups - 
Potential customer base in the early market for diabetes (district wise as given in target region section) is approx. 130k
Potential Customer Base * Your Target Price Range = Potential Profit
#### hence, 130k * Rs. 800 = Rs. 104,000,000.
So Potential profit is Rs. 10 crores 40 lakhs.

Potential customer base in the early market for blood pressure (district wise as given in target region section) is approx. 200k
Potential Customer Base * Your Target Price Range = Potential Profit
#### hence, 200k * Rs. 800 = Rs. 160,000,000.
So Potential profit is Rs. 16 crores. 

Potential customer base in the early market for vitamins deficiency (district wise as given in target region section) is approx. 80 lakhs
Potential Customer Base * Your Target Price Range = Potential Profit
#### hence, 80 lakhs * Rs. 800 = Rs. 6,400,000,000.
So Potential profit is Rs. 6 billion and 400 million.

A full body checkup will have the same numbers as diabetes or blood pressure cases

### For Device selling - .
The sales wont be matching to sales of home checkup services, as one device is sold, customers would again buy it after 5-6 at least. Hence retention rate would be low. Hence price will also vary between Rs. 1500 to Rs. 2500. Hence considering the scenario of early markets, the revenue model can be 60% - 40% or more recommended as 80%-20% of home service and device selling respectively. With experience, trust and brand awareness this ration can change.
So its profit as calculated above would be approx. Rs. 4 - 5 crores for these services.


## This is a surprisingly big amount but, In terms of making, traveling, and business costs, manufacturing, distribution the profit from actual sales will reduce. It is needed to look at gross margins, net profit after subtraction of costs and salaries. But some customers are already acquired by competitors so as given in above points of strategy, we must take steps so that customers will prefer us more.

If we work out and crack competition as given above and build strong trust and relation with customers as given in above strategy point, this can be successful in the early market and will grow in coming years.
